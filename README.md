# SpringBoot Integration-Test sample

Kotlin + Spring Boot 2.6.2 + Testcontainers(PostgreSQL) + MyBatis + DbUnit  
(prototype for myself)

# Features

I wrote this for myself because there was not enough good sample code for 
testing SpringBoot using Testcontainers.
Postgres container is reused.
The implementation focuses on how to use TestContainer in SpringBoot tests, 
and the rest is not implemented tightly. (e.g. Mapper called in RestController)
